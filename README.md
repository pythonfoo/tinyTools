# tinyTools

one tool per file

Any script that seems useful, but too small for its own repository lands here.  
Mostly in this style:

    myTinyTool.py
    myTinyTool.md

But without any warranty.

## WARNING ##

If a script does not have its own **\*.md** file, make SURE you know what the script does **BEFORE** you execute it!
